            <h1>DANCING</h1>
            <h2>I'm not an expert at dancing or anything but I still enjoy it. I took dance classes when I was young and ever since I have been prancing my way almost EVERYWHERE. In the MALL,AT HOME,AT SCHOOL,PUBLIC AREAS and I might have embarrased myself once or twice... or maybe more than that ;) DANCING WITH MY BEST FRIEND IS LOADS OF FUN :D</h2>
